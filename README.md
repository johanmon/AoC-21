# AoC-21
Advent of Coide 2021

Playing around with AoC 2021. I first implemented the Julia version and then did a similar implementation in Elixir. The Elixir code is slightly larger (+ 25%) mainly since we do not have vector operations built in. 

The code is written in a task by task order i.e. the two task for a day are both presented even though one could reimplement solutions to be more general.
